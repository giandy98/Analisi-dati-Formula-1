Analysis of the Formula 1 World Championship results of the 2008 season


This project involves the implementation of three functions for analysing performance in a Formula 1 championship:

1. Analysis of individual driver performance: Returns the total accumulated points, number of wins and podiums of a specific driver.
2. Creation of final driver rankings: Generates a dictionary with driver names and their point totals, then saves the rankings in a text file.
3. Manufacturer ranking function: Calculates team rankings by adding up the points of the drivers associated with each manufacturer, giving a clear view of team performance.

These functions serve to analyse both driver and team performance.
